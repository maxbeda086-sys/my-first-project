        <h2>BASICS: what I can do with html.</h2>

    <p div class="paragraph">
my story with programming started while I wondered how I could communicate with a computer, not like a user but a potential actor who participates at the creation of the large computer environment. 
to achieve this goal, I have watched a lot of videos on YouTube related to programming. and I've realized through my first attempts how much it could be fun to intereact with computers through programming.
    </P> 
    <P> What fascinated me was my ability to make the computer act or do what I want. it was amazing. since, i try to be in touch with programming along side my job as teacher.  so as long as I have free time, I'm coding with enthusiasm. even though mistakes and error feedback messages come a lot.</P> 
my favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is Visual Studio Code with its extensions such as Live Preview that allows me to watch directly in VS CODE the result of my work , intend rainbow, figma and so on...
Now  during my holidays I relearn to write code in html and CSS too.
</P>
    <p>I am  a little bit disappointed because with the end of my holidays in January the 5th 2026, I'll pause this learning  to be more focus on my job as a teacher in a secondary school. but because I love coding. maybe  I should say I love learning to code. I"ll find a way to keep in touch with that. 
to make things easy i usually use google to read articles about CSS and html.</p>
